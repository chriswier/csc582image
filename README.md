UM Flint CSC582 Image Storage in Oracle with NodeJS Web Frontend

Author: Chris Wieringa - cwiering@umich.edu or chris@wieringafamily.com

Purpose: CSC582 FA19 Oracle SQL and NodeJS Front/Backend Project for Dr. Halil Bisgin, CSC582, Fall 2019

Learning outcomes:
 1.  Figure out how to store/retrieve images in Oracle natively, and populate/retrieve metadata associated with the images.
 2.  Learn NodeJS as I have very little exposure to it
 3.  Learn and implement the NodeJS Oracle database interface

Project objectives:
 1.  Setup a self-contained VM with Oracle DB/NodeJS and Apache/NGINX if needed probably in Centos/Ubuntu Linux
 2.  Design a basic database, and load a research image dataset into Oracle using the native Oracle image data types.  Example dataset could be the COCO dataset from http://cocodataset.org/#home loaded using a scripting language.
 3.  Design a basic frontend/backend system using NodeJS for viewing images, performing searches on categories, captions, or image properties
 4.  Create an appropriate research paper on findings.
 5.  Create an appropriate presentation video via Youtube for class.
